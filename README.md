<h1>My Ecommerce Shop Project</h1>
<br>
<h4>Projects Requirements and milestones</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Build application and check for any build errors</li>
<li>Test each of the CRUD endpoints and ensure it works as anticipated.</li>
<li>Ensure that each of controller classes work and that our model is not glitchy</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Do not refactor the database design, this is just the mvp</li>
<li>It may be good to walk throught Matt's Typescript React course since this will be a 
Reactjs project</li>
<li>Finally create a React project within the prod directory & start working on the css 
from the figma file allocated</li>
<li>After Completion, start joining the API's</li>
<li>Ensure everything works, including forms for the POST & PUT requests</li>
<li>Finally, you can deploy and start iterating, adding more features, unit tests may 
start earlier but integration tests start here</li>
</ul>
